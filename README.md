# dockercon-2021-demo

Repository containing scaffolding for a Python 3-based data science project using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) ecosystem. 
Used as a demo for my DockerCon 2021 talk *Conda (+pip) and Docker FTW!*.

## Creating a new project from this template

Simply follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a new project repository from this template.

## Project organization

Project organization is based on ideas from [_Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing_](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put external scripts or compiled programs in the `bin` directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in a `data` directory.
4. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
5. Put all Docker related files in the `docker` directory.
6. Install the Conda environment into an `env` directory. 
7. Put all notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
8. Put files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
9. Put project source code in the `src` directory.
10. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

## Using Conda

### Creating the Conda environment

After adding any necessary dependencies for your project to the Conda `environment.yml` file 
(or the `requirements.txt` file), you can create the environment in a sub-directory of your 
project directory by running the following command.

```bash
PROJECT_DIR=$PWD
ENV_PREFIX=$PROJECT_DIR/env
conda env create --prefix $ENV_PREFIX --file $PROJECT_DIR/environment.yml --force
```

Once the new environment has been created you can activate the environment with the following 
command.

```bash
conda activate $ENV_PREFIX
```

Note that the `ENV_PREFIX` directory is *not* under version control as it can always be re-created as 
necessary.

For your convenience these commands have been combined in a shell script `./bin/create-conda-env.sh`. 
The script should be run from the project root directory as follows. 

```bash
./bin/create-conda-env.sh
```

### Listing the full contents of the Conda environment

The list of explicit dependencies for the project are listed in the `environment.yml` file. To see 
the full lost of packages installed into the environment run the following command.

```bash
conda list --prefix $ENV_PREFIX
```

### Updating the Conda environment

If you add (remove) dependencies to (from) the `environment.yml` file or the `requirements.txt` file 
after the environment has already been created, then you can re-create the environment with the 
following command.

```bash
./bin/create-conda-env.sh
```

## Using Docker

In order to build Docker images for your project and run containers you will need to install 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Detailed instructions for using Docker to build and image and launch containers can be found in 
the `docker/README.md`.
